# Fixes Summary - Unread Indicators & Contact Sorting

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Unread Message Indicators Not Showing
**Root Cause:** The backend was not incrementing the `unread_count` field when new messages arrived.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `backend/app/Services/WhatsAppMessageService.php` (lines 88-91)
- **Change:** Added code to increment `unread_count` for incoming messages
```php
// Increment unread count for incoming messages
if ($message->direction === 'incoming') {
    $chat->incrementUnreadCount();
}
```

**Frontend Implementation:**
- **File:** `frontend/vue-project/src/views/MessagesView.vue`
- Green badge shows unread count next to chat names
- Badge only appears when chat is not selected
- Shows "99+" for counts over 99
- Automatically marks chat as read when selected

### 2. User's Own Number Not Showing in Contact List
**Root Cause:** The contact filter was excluding phone number formats, which included the user's own number.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `frontend/vue-project/src/components/ContactsModal.vue` (lines 217-248)
- **Change:** Updated filter logic to include user's own number (4915908115183) even if it's in phone number format
- **Sorting:** User's own number always appears at the top, others sorted alphabetically

## How to Test

### Testing Unread Indicators:
1. Restart all services:
   ```powershell
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend/vue-project
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 3 - Receiver
   cd receiver
   npm start
   ```

2. Send a message from WhatsApp to your number
3. Check the chat list - you should see a green badge with the unread count
4. Click on the chat - the badge should disappear

### Testing Contact Sorting:
1. Open the Contacts modal (click "Kontakte" button)
2. Look for your number (+49 1590 8115183) - it should be at the very top
3. Other contacts should be sorted alphabetically below it

## Debug Information

### Check Browser Console:
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Look for console logs showing:
  - `Loaded chats:` - Shows all chats with their unread_count
  - `Fetched contacts:` - Shows all contacts loaded

### Check Backend Logs:
```powershell
cd backend
tail -f storage/logs/whatsapp.log
```
Look for:
- `Message saved successfully` - Should show `unread_count` field
- `Created new chat` - When new chats are created

## Expected Behavior

### Unread Indicators:
- ✅ Green badge appears next to chats with unread messages
- ✅ Badge shows number (1, 2, 3... or 99+)
- ✅ Badge disappears when chat is selected
- ✅ Backend increments count on new incoming messages
- ✅ Backend resets count when chat is marked as read

### Contact List:
- ✅ User's own number (+49 1590 8115183) always at top
- ✅ Other contacts sorted alphabetically
- ✅ Sorting works even when searching/filtering
- ✅ Phone number comparison handles various formats

## Troubleshooting

### If unread indicators still don't show:
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify backend is incrementing count:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name, unread_count FROM chats;
   ```
4. Send a test message and check if count increases

### If contact not showing:
1. Check browser console for "Fetched contacts:" log
2. Verify the contact exists in the database
3. Check if the phone number matches exactly: 4915908115183
4. Make sure the contact has a custom name (not just a phone number)

## Files Modified

2. `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/ChatController.php` - Implement markAsRead endpoint
3. `frontend/vue-project/src/views/MessagesView.vue` - Add unread badge UI & mark as read logic
