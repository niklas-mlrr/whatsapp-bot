## Changes Applied

### ✅ 1. Empty Chat Screen Background
**Changed:** Empty "Wähle einen Chat, um Nachrichten zu senden" screen now has `dark:bg-zinc-800` background
**Result:** Matches the sidebar color for visual consistency

### ✅ 2. Sidebar Lightened
**Changed:** Sidebar from `dark:bg-zinc-900` to `dark:bg-zinc-800`
**Changed:** All sidebar borders from `dark:border-zinc-800` to `dark:border-zinc-700`
**Result:** Sidebar is now slightly lighter and more visible

### ✅ 3. Unread Indicator - Improved Logging & Timing
**Problem:** Indicator was being saved immediately after being set

**Changes:**
- Increased initial load delay from 1 second to 2 seconds
- Added more detailed console logging:
  - `🚫 Skipped saving (initial load, isAtBottom: true)` - Shows when save is prevented
  - `💾 Saved lastRead to localStorage: [ID] (isInitialLoad: false)` - Shows when save happens
  - `✅ Initial load complete, scroll handler now active` - Shows when 2 seconds have passed

**How it should work now:**
1. Open chat → `isInitialLoad = true`
2. Indicator is set: `✅ Unread indicator set for message: 252`
3. Auto-scroll happens but save is skipped: `🚫 Skipped saving (initial load, isAtBottom: true)`
4. After 2 seconds: `✅ Initial load complete, scroll handler now active`
5. Now when you scroll to bottom, it will save: `💾 Saved lastRead to localStorage: 254`

**Testing:**
1. Open a chat with unread messages
2. Watch console - you should see `🚫 Skipped saving` messages
3. Wait 2 seconds for `✅ Initial load complete`
4. Indicator should stay visible
5. Manually scroll to bottom after 2 seconds
6. Now it should save and clear the indicator

### ✅ 4. Removed "Bearbeiten" Tooltip
**Changed:** Removed `title="Bearbeiten"` attribute from edit button in ContactsModal
**Result:** No tooltip appears when hovering over the edit icon

## Current Color Scheme

### Dark Mode:
- **Main background:** `dark:bg-black`
- **Sidebar:** `dark:bg-zinc-800` (lightened)
- **Empty chat screen:** `dark:bg-zinc-800` (matches sidebar)
- **Chat messages area:** `dark:bg-zinc-900` (slightly darker than sidebar)
- **Borders:** `dark:border-zinc-700` (sidebar), `dark:border-zinc-800` (modals)
- **Cards/Items:** `dark:bg-zinc-800`

### Visual Hierarchy:
```
Main BG (black) 
  ├─ Sidebar (zinc-800) - lighter
  │   └─ Borders (zinc-700)
  └─ Chat Area (zinc-900) - slightly darker
      └─ Message bubbles (zinc-800)
```

## Console Output Reference

### Successful Unread Indicator Flow:
```
📖 Selecting chat: 50 lastReadId from localStorage: 251
✅ Set lastReadMessageId in MessageList: 251
Sorted messages changed, count: 18 lastReadMessageId: 251
Last read message index: 14
First unread candidate: 252 isFromMe: false content: Test
✅ Unread indicator set for message: 252
🚫 Skipped saving (initial load, isAtBottom: true)
[Wait 2 seconds...]
✅ Initial load complete, scroll handler now active
[Manually scroll to bottom...]
💾 Saved lastRead to localStorage: 254 (isInitialLoad: false)
```

### If Indicator Still Doesn't Show:
The issue might be that the auto-scroll is happening multiple times. Check if you see multiple `🚫 Skipped saving` messages. If so, the scroll handler is being triggered repeatedly during initial load.
