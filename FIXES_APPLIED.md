# Fixes Applied - October 19, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Dark Mode - Less Blue-Themed Colors
**Problem:** Dark mode had too much blue coloring
**Solution:** 
- Changed loading text from `dark:text-blue-400` to `dark:text-gray-400` for a more neutral look
- Adjusted error messages to use `dark:text-red-300` instead of `dark:text-red-400`
- The overall color scheme now uses more neutral grays with green accents (matching the app's theme)

### 2. ✅ Contact Modal Dark Mode Support
**Problem:** ContactsModal and contact editing modal didn't have dark mode styling
**Solution:** Added comprehensive dark mode classes to:
- **Main modal container:** `dark:bg-gray-800`
- **Headers and titles:** `dark:text-gray-100`
- **Borders:** `dark:border-gray-700`
- **Search input:** Full dark mode styling with `dark:bg-gray-700`, `dark:text-gray-100`, `dark:placeholder-gray-500`
- **Contact list items:** `dark:bg-gray-700` with `dark:hover:bg-gray-600`
- **Contact avatars:** `dark:bg-green-700` with `dark:text-green-200`
- **Form inputs:** Complete dark mode styling for name and phone inputs
- **Buttons:** Dark mode hover states
- **Info notices:** `dark:bg-blue-900/20` with `dark:text-blue-200`

### 3. ✅ User's Own Number Sorting
**Problem:** User's own number (+49 1590 8115183) wasn't appearing at the top of the contact list
**Solution:** 
- Enhanced the sorting logic to check multiple number format variations:
  - `1590 8115183` (with space)
  - `15908115183` (without country code)
  - `4915908115183` (with country code, no +)
  - `+4915908115183` (full international format)
  - `49 1590 8115183` (with spaces)
- Added checks across multiple fields:
  - `chat.name`
  - `chat.participants` (array)
  - `chat.metadata.whatsapp_id`
  - `chat.original_name`
- Added console logging to help debug if the number still doesn't appear:
  - Logs when the number is found in any field
  - Logs the final sorted chat list

**Debugging:** Check the browser console to see:
1. If your number is being detected in any chat
2. The structure of all chats after sorting

### 4. ✅ Unread Message Indicator
**Problem:** The "Neue Nachrichten" divider wasn't being displayed
**Solution:**
- Fixed the watch logic to use `sortedMessages` instead of `messages`
- Split the watch into two separate watchers:
  1. One for initial scroll behavior
  2. One specifically for calculating the unread indicator
- Added console logging: `console.log('Unread indicator set for message:', firstUnread.id)`
- Improved the logic to properly clear the indicator when there are no unread messages

**How it works:**
1. When you open a chat, it loads the last read message ID from localStorage
2. It finds that message in the sorted list
3. It marks the next message (if it's from someone else) as the first unread
4. When you scroll to the bottom, it updates the last read message ID and clears the indicator

**Debugging:** Check the browser console for:
- "Unread indicator set for message: [ID]" - confirms the indicator is being set
- Check localStorage for keys like `lastRead_[chatId]` to see stored values

## Testing Instructions

### Dark Mode Colors
1. Toggle dark mode on
2. Verify the colors are more neutral gray (not too blue)
3. Check that text is readable and not too bright

### Contact Modal Dark Mode
1. Click "Kontakte" button
2. Verify the modal has dark background
3. Try searching - input should be dark themed
4. Click "Neuer Kontakt" - form should be dark themed
5. Edit a contact - all fields should be dark themed

### User's Own Number Sorting
1. Open the browser console (F12)
2. Look for console logs showing if your number was detected
3. Check if a chat with your number appears at the top
4. If not found, check the console output showing all chat structures
5. You may need to create a chat with your own number first if it doesn't exist

### Unread Message Indicator
1. Open a chat and scroll to the bottom
2. Close the chat (or refresh the page)
3. Have someone send you a message (or send one from another device)
4. Reopen the chat
5. You should see a green "Neue Nachrichten" divider before the new messages
6. Check the console for "Unread indicator set for message: [ID]"
7. Scroll to the bottom - the indicator should disappear

## Known Limitations

1. **User's Own Number:** If you don't have a chat with your own number in the system, it won't appear. You may need to create a chat with yourself first.

2. **Unread Indicator:** Only works for messages received while the chat was closed. If you're actively viewing the chat when messages arrive, they're immediately marked as read.

3. **Dark Mode:** Some third-party components or dynamically loaded content might not have dark mode styling.
