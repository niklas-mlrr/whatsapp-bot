# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: RUN THIS MIGRATION NOW ⚠️

The reply feature is sending `reply_to_message_id: '292'` to the backend (as shown in your console logs), but the database doesn't have this column yet!

## Run this command NOW:

```bash
cd backend
php artisan migrate
```

## What the logs show:

✅ Frontend is working correctly:
- Reply button clicked: `{id: '292', content: 'Ich', ...}`
- Payload sent: `{reply_to_message_id: '292', ...}`

❌ Backend needs the migration:
- The `whatsapp_messages` table doesn't have the `reply_to_message_id` column yet
- The migration file exists: `2025_10_19_210000_add_reply_to_message_id_to_whatsapp_messages.php`
- You just need to run `php artisan migrate`

## After running the migration:

1. Send a reply message
2. The backend will save the `reply_to_message_id`
3. When fetching messages, the backend will return the `quoted_message` data
4. The frontend will display the quoted message above the reply

That's it!
