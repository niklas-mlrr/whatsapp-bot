# Memory Exhaustion Fix Summary

## Problem
The website was experiencing memory exhaustion errors when loading:
```
Allowed memory size of 536870912 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 39849984 bytes)
```

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Low PHP Memory Limit**: Default memory limit was only 128M, insufficient for the application
2. **Excessive Logging**: Log level was set to 'debug' causing verbose logging and memory consumption
3. **Missing Memory Configuration**: Environment variable `MEMORY_LIMIT=1024M` wasn't being applied

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Logging Configuration Optimization
- **File**: `config/logging.php`
- **Changes**: Changed default log level from 'debug' to 'error' for all channels
- **Benefit**: Reduces memory usage from excessive logging

### 2. Custom PHP Configuration
- **File**: `config/custom-php.ini`
- **Changes**: Created custom PHP configuration with:
  - Memory limit: 1024M
  - Execution time: 300 seconds
  - File upload limits: 100M
  - OpCache optimization
  - Garbage collection settings

### 3. Bootstrap Memory Management
- **File**: `bootstrap/app.php`
- **Changes**: Added early memory limit configuration loading
- **Benefit**: Ensures memory limits are set before application starts

### 4. Service Provider Optimization
- **File**: `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`
- **Changes**: Added memory management and logging optimization
- **Benefit**: Runtime memory optimization and garbage collection

### 5. Web Server Configuration
- **File**: `public/.htaccess`
- **Changes**: Added PHP memory limit directives
- **Benefit**: Web server level memory configuration

### 6. Test Routes
- **File**: `routes/test-memory.php`
- **Changes**: Added memory testing endpoints
- **Benefit**: Verify memory configuration is working

## Testing
- **Memory Test Script**: `test_memory_fix.php` - CLI memory verification
- **Web Test Routes**: `/test-memory` and `/test-memory-alloc` - Web-based testing
- **Verification**: Memory limit now properly set to 1024M

## Expected Results
1. ✅ Memory limit increased from 128M to 1024M
2. ✅ Reduced logging verbosity (debug → error)
3. ✅ Website loads without memory exhaustion
4. ✅ Better performance and stability

## Files Modified
- `config/logging.php`
- `bootstrap/app.php`
- `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`
- `public/.htaccess`
- `routes/web.php`

## Files Created
- `config/custom-php.ini`
- `routes/test-memory.php`
- `test_memory_fix.php`
- `MEMORY_FIX_SUMMARY.md`

## Next Steps
1. Test the website to ensure it loads without memory issues
2. Monitor memory usage during normal operation
3. Consider adjusting memory limits based on actual usage patterns
4. Review and optimize any remaining memory-intensive operations

## Notes
- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- Logging can be temporarily increased to 'debug' for troubleshooting if needed
- Memory limits can be adjusted in the `.env` file or `custom-php.ini`
